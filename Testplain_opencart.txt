Test Plan for Open Cart Application
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this test plan is to outline the testing strategy for the Open Cart application modules: Registration, Login, Order Page, and Payment Method. The goal is to ensure that each module functions as expected and meets the specified requirements.

1.2 Scope
This test plan covers functional, performance, security, and usability testing of the Registration, Login, Order Page, and Payment Method modules. It excludes testing of third-party integrations and non-functional aspects outside the defined scope.

1.3 Objectives

Verify that all modules perform their intended functions.
Identify and fix defects.
Ensure the application is user-friendly and secure.
